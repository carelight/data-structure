given 
 names = ["Mary","John","Emma"]
 heights = [180,165,170]
 you have to order names in decreasing order of their heights
 output- ["Mary","Emma","John"]
  Approach- 
     in accordance with their names and height store them in map;          mp[heights[i]]=names[i];
      now sort heights ;
      run a loop from last to first in heights and push_back the valuers of map accordance with the height in a vector
       for(int i=heights.size()-1;i>=0;i--){
                ams.push_back(mp[heights[i]]);
        return ans;
        
  code- 
  class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> sortPeople(vector<string>& names, vector<int>& heights) {
        unordered_map<int,string> mp;
        vector<string> ams;
        for(int i=0;i<names.size();i++){
            mp[heights[i]]=names[i];
        }
        sort(heights.begin(),heights.end());
          for(int i=heights.size()-1;i>=0;i--){
                ams.push_back(mp[heights[i]]);
          }
        return ams;
    }
};
