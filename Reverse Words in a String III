//leetcode - 557
given s = "Let's take LeetCode contest" 
u have to reverse to make it look like
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
Approach- we will take a start position at i=0   after that we will traverse from j=o to n 
and when we detect space j=" " we will reverse string from i to j and update i= j+1
uon reaching end we will have i at last space and we will reverse from i to end of array 
code-
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
          int i = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < s.size(); ++j) {
            if (s[j] == ' ') {
                reverse(s.begin() + i, s.begin() + j);
                i = j + 1;
            }
        }
        reverse(s.begin() + i, s.end());
        return s;
    }
};
