//leetcode-1752
//Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, 
then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return false.
//example-  nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Approach - if we will keep taversing along array and find if next elemnt if less than it if so then 
that means you have the position from where if it will be rotated it will be declared as sorted 
-if such condition is more than 1 times that means the given array is not in a order from where even if we 
rotate its not gonna sorted 
example - 5,3,4,2,1 as you can see if i count the point of decrement it lies in more than 2 positions
at 5,3 and 4,2 

code-
class Solution {
public:
    bool check(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        int count=0;
        int n=nums.size();
        
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            if(nums[i]>nums[(i+1)%n])count++;
        }
        
        return count<=1;   // checking the count of points where next one is decreasing 
    }
};
