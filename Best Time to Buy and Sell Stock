//leetcode -121
//given a single array showing array of price of stock at days u can buy and sell only one time to get max profit
// prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
//o.p= 5
// Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
to do so we will first get minimum price and then and then substract it with the remaning elements ahead in array and get maximum profit from it

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int mins =prices[0];
         int pro=0,maxpro=0;
         for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++)
         {
             mins = min(mins,prices[i]);
             pro= prices[i]-mins;
              maxpro=max(maxpro,pro);
         }
       return maxpro;  
       
    }
};
