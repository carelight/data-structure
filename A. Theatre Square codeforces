given - A rectangle of "n*m" dimenson and some  squares  one of dimenson " a "to cover the rectangle 
 also its ok if squares size extends boundary of rectangle.
to find : find number of squares to cover rectangle 
  
  approach : we know number of squares  can be calculated as 
   number of squares fitted at length of rec. * number of rectangle fitted in breadth of rec.

using namespace std;

int main()
{
  long long int n, m, a, sum;
  cin >> n >> m >> a;

  if (n % a == 0)             //check if they fit exactly or not
    sum = n / a;
  else
    sum = n / a + 1;                //if its not zero then u need one more to fill

  if (m % a == 0)
  {
    sum = sum * m / a;
  }
  else
  {
    sum = sum * ((m / a) + 1);
  }
  cout<<sum<<endl;
  return 0;
